# STAFFINC - ILHAM TRI MULYAWAN
How to run
1. Install IntelliJ IDEA
2. Clone this repo
3. Go To pom.xml and then click load maven
4. Go To search.feature and click run -> for UI test 
Notes : For this scenario, the expected result cannot be achieved because the step to click on the city in the search is difficult to perform due to the element not being easily clickable on the website. Therefore, I have created this test up to the final step. I will have many suggestions for the web elements of Staffinc if I join.
5. Go To api.feature and click run -> for api test
